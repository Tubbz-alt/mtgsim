# mtgsim
Simple Magic the Gathering (MTG) deck mulligan and goldfish simulator in Java.

# What?
I am sharing my code that I used to simulate mulligans for Eldrazi Stompy decks described on [Modern Nexus](http://modernnexus.com/rebuilding-colorless-eldrazi-stompy/#comment-6235) by Jordan Boisvert.

# How?
Look for simulation results (as CSV files) under mtgsim/csv; Use spreadsheet software of your choice to examine the simulations (hint: pivot tables).
